BF.hs
=====

BF.hs is a fairly naive brainfuck parser and interpreter written in Haskell.

I've been exploring parsing text in Haskell (using Parsec) lately and came up
with the idea of writing a Parser for Brainfuck. Once I had that, I thought
I might implement an interpreter just as well.

I have written Brainfuck interpreters in C and Python before but I thought I'd
be interesting to see how a functional implementation would look like.
